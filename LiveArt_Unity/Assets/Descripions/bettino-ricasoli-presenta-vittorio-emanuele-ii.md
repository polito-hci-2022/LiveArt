## Description

Following the Armistice of Villafranca, which will bring an end to the Second War of Independence, the provisional government of Tuscany called for a plebiscite to ratify its annexation to the Kingdom of Sardinia.

The vast majority of Tuscans voted in favor of annexation, with little surprise given that over the years the people had repeatedly expressed support for the cause of the House of Savoy.

In the painting we see depicted Bettino Ricasoli, at the time the Prime Minister of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, reporting the results of the plebiscite to Vittorio Emanuele II. Following the great success and the personal recognition of his merits, he was first appointed provisional governor of Tuscany and then Minister of the Interior in what will be the Kingdom of Italy.

## Interpretation I -- Classic 

The author captures a moment of great importance in 1863, when in Brollo, a small Tuscan town Ricasoli is welcomed by the sovereign Vittorio Emanuele. 
Bettino is in the center of the canvas and everyone seems to observe him  

## Interpretation II -- Modern

Looking carefully at the canvas you can see the presence of several nobles to surround the king but also dining room. 
The characters are all intent on listening to Bettino except for the first left that looks away
