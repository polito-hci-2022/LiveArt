## Description

In September 1859, Bettino Ricasoli, then Minister of the Interior of the provisional government of Tuscany, announced a competition for the creation of works of art on the theme of the Risorgimento.
Among those created is this painting by Antonio Puccinelli, who at the time was a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Florence.

The subject portrayed is Vincenzo Gioberti, an Italian chaplain and politician, who became known for his proximity to the Risorgimento movements.
Initially in favor of a united Italy led by the church, later he will change his mind and support the Savoyard cause, and also become President of the Council of Ministers of the Kingdom of Sardinia.
