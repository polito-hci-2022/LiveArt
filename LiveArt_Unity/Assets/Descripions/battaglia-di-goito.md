## Title
### Battaglia di Goito (Battle of Goito)

## Author
### Felice Cerruti Bauduc (1818-1896)

## Date
### 1848

## Description

Upon returning from the First Italian War of Independence, Cerruti decided to pursue an artistic career where he would reenact scenes of battle.

The painting depicts the attack by the Austrian army on the Piedmontese army stationed in defense of the bridge over the Mincio, near Goito.
The battle ended in favor of the Piedmontese army.

Before enlisting, Cerruti completed studies in veterinary medicine, which is why in his paintings we can notice great detail in depicting animals, particularly horses, as in this example.
This greatly contributed to his success even well before the War of Independence began.
