## Description

Massimo d'Azeglio is known in history for both his artistic qualities as a painter and writer, as well as his political ones, first as a member of parliament and then as a senator of the Kingdom of Sardinia. At the time of the painting, he held the position of Governor of the Province of Milan.

The painting is by Francesco Gonin, a painter known for his portraits of illustrious figures, including King Vittorio Emanuele II and King Umberto I, but not only: in fact, the frescoes in the ballroom of the Royal Palace of Turin are also his work.
